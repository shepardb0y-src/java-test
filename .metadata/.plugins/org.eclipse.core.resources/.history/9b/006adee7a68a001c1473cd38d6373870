//We have a parrot that likes to squawk at night in its cage when it’s scared. Write a method named getUp that has
//2 parameters

//1st parameter  should be a boolean and be named squawking it represent the parrot.

//2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is an int named currentHour has a valid range of 0-23.

//We have to get up if the parrot is squawking before 6 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.

//All other cases will return false. If the currentHour parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false
